Основная проблема было в том что тот скрипт должен срабатывать когда наш HTML полностью отрисуется иначе
мы просто не можем получить ссылку на нужный элмент.
По требованию мы должны скрипт добавить в Head по умолчанию этот скрипт отрабатывает до отрисовки html мне нужно поймать момент когда html отрисуется и в этот момент изменить контент. 
По этому я использовал window события - load
